# Coding Challenge Solution - Day 38

This repository contains my solution to the coding challenge presented on Day 38 of Angela Yu's '100 Days of Python' course. This challange is to create a exercise tracker using Sheety and Nutritionix(üêû) API.
I've provided my solution to the challenge as a reference and learning resource. You can explore the code to see how I approached the problem and gain insights into different techniques and strategies.

I've used OOP to structure the code. 

Please note that this repository contains my personal solution, and it may not be the only or the most optimal solution to the challenge.
It's always encouraged to attempt the challenges on your own and compare your solution with others.

Feel free to clone the repository, examine the code, and use it as a reference for your own learning. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!

Happy coding!
